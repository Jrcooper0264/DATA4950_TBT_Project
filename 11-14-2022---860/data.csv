Founded by Dr. Benjamin Rush  a signer of the Declaration of Independence  the College was chartered in 1783  just days after the conclusion of the American Revolution with the specific purpose of preparing the citizens and leaders who would ensure the success of the new democracy. It was to offer a distinctively original form of American education - one that was rigorously rooted in the traditional liberal arts and was  at the same time  innovative  forward-looking and ultimately useful. It was a revolutionary education designed for a revolutionary age.

As we face the challenges and complexities of the 21st century  Dickinson continues to seek direction from this revolutionary heritage within a contemporary context. A Dickinson education prepares its graduates to become the citizen leaders of their generation by incorporating a global vision that permeates the entire student experience  creating a community of inquiry that allows students to cross disciplinary boundaries and make new intellectual connections  and encouraging students to be enterprising and active by engaging their communities  the nation and the world.

Dickinson offers a liberal arts education that is distinctive in purpose and approach. Our founders intended Dickinson graduates to use their liberal arts education as a powerful agent of change to advance the lot of humankind. We expect no less today.,,

The primary mission of Endicott College is to instill in students an understanding of and an appreciation for professional and liberal studies.  Deeply woven within this philosophy is the concept of applied learning which has been the hallmark of Endicott.  Linking classroom and off campus work experience through required internships remains the most distinguishing feature of the College.

Endicott has a vision for the total development of the individual within a community which fosters an appreciation of cultural diversity  international awareness  community service  and moral and ethical values.  Endicott is an innovative and vibrant  student centered institution which supports students in their pursuit of knowledge.  

Naturally  no two students experience Endicott in the same way or at the same pace.  Yet common threads run through the fabric of the "Endicott experience": increased self-confidence  stronger professional skills and technological competencies  and perhaps the most valued of all  lives open to change.

Education takes place not only inside well-taught classes  but also outside in well-run off-campus programs and well-conceived service projects.

Its charter provided that "the University is forever to be conducted on the most liberal principles  accessible to all religious denominations  and designed for the benefit of our citizens in general."  In the spirit of this heritage  the University defines itself as a community of teachers and students devoted to the free pursuit of truth.  It attempts to develop in its students qualities of intellect and character that will be useful no matter what they choose to do in later life.

Ohio Wesleyan judges itself successful when it has accomplished three objectives in its work with students:  The first is to impart knowledge.  The second major objective is to develop and enhance certain important capabilities of students  including the foundation skills of reading  writing  and quantitative analysis.  The third objective is to place education in the context of values.

To the extent that Ohio Wesleyan educates liberally  it fulfills its ultimate purpose of equipping students with knowledge  competence  and character for leadership  service  and continued learning in a complex and increasingly global society.,,

For all who choose to seek a PLU degree  the university offers opportunity to pursue a variety of programs of academic worth and excellence.

The diversity and variety of cultural programs and personal services offered by the university are intended to facilitate this positive development of the student as a whole person in order that our students might function as members of society.
In other words  PLU affirms that realization of one's highest potential as well a fulfillment of life's purpose arise in the joy of service to others.  To aid its students in sharing this understanding  the university seeks to be a community in which there is a continuing and fruitful interaction between what is best in education and what is noblest in Christian edification.

A professional and graduate school of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)  the Seminary stands within the Reformed tradition  affirming the sovereignty of the triune God over all creation  the Gospel of Jesus Christ as God’s saving word for all people  the renewing power of the word and Spirit in all of life  and the unity of Christ’s servant church throughout the world. This tradition shapes the instruction  research  practical training  and continuing education provided by the Seminary  as well as the theological scholarship it promotes.

In response to Christ’s call for the unity of the church  the Seminary embraces in its life and work a rich racial and ethnic diversity and the breadth of communions represented in the worldwide church. In response to the transforming work of the Holy Spirit  the Seminary offers its theological scholarship in service to God’s renewal of the church’s life and mission. In response to God’s sovereign claim over all creation  the Seminary seeks to engage Christian faith with intellectual  political  and economic life in pursuit of truth  justice  compassion  and peace.

To these ends  the Seminary provides a residential community of worship and learning where a sense of calling is tested and defined  where Scripture and the Christian tradition are appropriated critically  where faith and intellect mature and life-long friendships begin  and where habits of discipleship are so nourished that members of the community may learn to proclaim with conviction  courage  wisdom  and love the good news that Jesus Christ is Lord.

UNIVERSITY MISSION
Santa Clara University is a Catholic and Jesuit institution that makes student learning its central focus  promotes faculty and staff learning in its various forms  and exhibits organizational learning as it deals with the challenges facing it.

Student learning takes place at the undergraduate and graduate level in an educa­tional environment that integrates rigorous inquiry and scholarship  creative imagi­nation  reflective engagement with society  and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world.

As an academic community  we expand the boundaries of knowledge and insight through teaching  research  artistic expression  and other forms of scholarship. It is primarily through discovering  communicating  and applying knowledge that we exercise our institutional responsibility as a voice of reason and conscience in society.

We offer challenging academic programs and demonstrate a commitment to the development of:

Undergraduate students who seek an education with a strong humanistic orien­tation in a primarily residential setting.
Graduate students  many of them working professionals in Silicon Valley  who seek advanced degree programs that prepare them to make significant contribu­tions to their fields.
In addition to these core programs  we also provide a variety of continuing education and professional development opportunities for nonmatriculated students.

In 1937 the New Program  under which the college still operates  was instituted.  Under it  we help our students learn to ask fundamental questions and practice thoughtfulness in public.  We introduce them to the textual tradition of reason that illuminates such central features of modern life as democracy and technology  as well as to the literary and musical tradition of the West.  We are committed to the use of a list of "great books" that is both fairly stable and under continual review.  These are books agreed to be excellent  to form a coherent sequence  and to raise most cogently questions we want our students to consider.  We foster literacy in three kinds of texts:  verbal  mathematical  and musical.  We want our students to develop the intellectual virtues of courage in inquiry  caution in forming opinions  candor about their ignorance  open attentiveness to the words of their colleagues  industry in preparation  and meticulousness in verbal translations as well as in mathematical demonstrations.  We give our students the experience of living in a community of learning imbued with attitudes of consideration and respect that foster moral virtues appropriate to their future lives as citizens.  We think that the college has a wider mission in contributing to the invigoration of American education by giving help to other institutions that ask for it  by encouraging our students to become teachers  and by providing to a wide constituency occasions for actual learning in the spirit and through the materials of our program.,,

Nearly a century after the School’s founding  however  the role of the performing artist has evolved as the world in which artists function has undergone dramatic transformations and as challenges to the social fabric of our nation have threatened support for the presentation and study of the performing arts.  Recognizing the increasing obstacles that our young people will face as they pursue careers as performing artists  the School has refined and expanded its statement of mission to include four goals:

1.	Juilliard’s central mission is to educate talented performing musicians  dancers and actors so that they may achieve the highest artistic standards  as well as becoming leaders in their professions.  Through this process we will also help them to become thoughtful  confident and responsible adults.

2.	 Juilliard should make every effort to provide students with the emotional  social  professional and educational foundation necessary for them to embark on successful careers and productive lives as artists  leaders and citizens.

3.	The Juilliard education should continue to elevate its high educational and artistic standards  while also inculcating in students a sense of their own professional responsibilities for enhancing the classical arts and for enabling those arts to serve society more effectively.

4.	Juilliard should take an active  not passive  role in shaping the future of the classical arts  both by intensifying its internal commitment to artistic education and by reaching beyond its doors to help the classical arts thrive anew.

This mission is the end by which all means are judged – from customs of community life to curricular decisions and faculty appointments  to building design and forms of governance. +++

To accomplish its mission  the College has a single  substantially unvarying program with no majors  minors  or electives. It consists in an integrated and orderly study of the liberal arts and sciences  beginning with the fundamental arts of the trivium and quadrivium  proceeding through the natural and political sciences  and culminating in theology. The College achieves its mission chiefly through reflective consideration of seminal questions raised in classical texts. These texts – often referred to as the “Great Books” – are selected by the faculty under the guidance of the Catholic tradition. In accordance with this tradition  the works of St. Thomas Aquinas occupy a preeminent position in the College’s curriculum. +++

Classes are seminars and tutorials: groups of fifteen to twenty students discussing the readings under the guidance of a faculty member. A laboratory program provides students laboratory experience in addition to the reading of primary texts. Tutorials  seminars  and laboratories are complemented by a lecture and concert series. This offers students an opportunity to witness and discuss the scholarly and artistic works of the wider community. +++

The College’s educational principles and curriculum arise from an intellectual tradition which does not fluctuate with the vicissitudes of time  founded as it is in a perennial wisdom by which the truth and merit of new insights and discoveries may be best understood. The College aims to sustain the natural wonder of students  to develop their intellectual virtues  and to help them satisfy their desire to know things noble and worth knowing.,,

     First  the College believes it is obligated to create in students a lifelong commitment to truth and joy in learning  so that students weave the pursuit of knowledge into the fabric of their lives  and develop a historical awareness and intellectual integrity that will support a resolve to defend the dignity of all people.
     Second  the College believes that knowledge of the self is an important goal of liberal education  a goal that is best attained as one learns more about other cultures and one's own. Consequently  we offer extensive opportunities for study abroad  and curricular and residential experiences that enable students to see the ways in which they are part of something larger--a community  a culture  and a world of many cultures.
     Third  the College believes that the close relationship between its faculty and students motivates students to learn  as manifested most clearly in undergraduate research and other forms of independent study. We therefore maintain a community of inquiry  discourse  and experiment in which it is clear that scholarship and teaching are parts of a single enterprise. Consistent with the belief that professional education is best done in the context of the liberal arts undertaking  the College supports the oldest such engineering program in the nation.
     In many respects  then  Union is distinctive  but in an important sense it is like other good liberal arts colleges  with strong departments  staffed by a scholarly faculty with an exacting care for the students' accuracy of understanding and for the improvement of their ability to do their work well. One conviction underlies life at Union  its common beliefs  and its long heritage: in citizenship as well as work  a liberal education is the best path to personal fulfillment.,,

The University seeks to offer those graduate and professional programs which will address important needs of society  and which can be offered in a manner consistent with the University’s primary institutional commitments.
     The University as a whole is shaped by the long tradition of Catholic learning and acknowledges its commitment to the Catholic Church and its teaching.  ,,

WyoTech's programs meet industry specifications and faclty/industry interactions  WyoTech Continually upgrades and modifies programs to enhance each graduate's employability.  
WyoTech's primary objectives are to impart specific knowledge and skills  to graduate each and every student who begins training  and to place them in their chosen fields.  In order to achieve these objectives  the curriculum  the faculty and staff  and the facilities and learning environment become equally important.  
WyoTech's curricula allow students to concentrate exclusively on learning technical skills in diploma programs or to expand their education with associate degree programs.
WyoTech prepares students for the post-graduation working world by teaching on a workday  not a school day schedule.  Students attend classes approximately eight hours a day  five days a week.
The faculty and staff respect the professional decision students have made to enter career training.  We believe professionalism is as important an aspect of training as are technical and business skills.  For that reason  WyoTech has established rules and regulations concerning attendance  behavior and academic performance in classrooms  labs and shops.  These rules are enforced  both on campus and in housing  and each student's grades are adjusted weekly to reflect "professionalism points."  Professionalism develops a positive attitude  personal motivation  and career pride.  These elements  combined with technical expertise  produce a WyoTech graduate--a skilled professional technician.,,

The Yeshiva does this by providing a rich Halachic  Mussar  and Ethical background in conjunction with a comprehensive program of Talmudic study and analysis. Graduates from this program will have attained a high level of proficiency in the subjects covered.

	The Yeshiva blends a Lithuanian style of learning into its Chassidic atmosphere.  Not only is the study of Torah and Talmud intensive and well paced  but it is also infused with a Chassidic enthusiasm.  Students explore the depths of the Talmud with the love of tradition which traces itself back to the original Spinka community of Rumania.

On the undergraduate level  this belief is embodied in the dual curriculum under which students pursue a full program of Jewish studies while taking college programs in the liberal arts and sciences and business and receiving specialized preparation for advanced work in a discipline or profession. On the graduate level  this special mission is embodied in emphasis on the moral dimensions of the search for knowledge and the ethical principles that govern professional practitioners. 

Yeshiva University also is committed to the love of learning for its own sake (known in Jewish tradition as Torah Lishmah) and to teaching and research that stress a striving for excellence. 

A third goal of the University is to serve the general and Jewish communities of the city  the nation  and the world by preparing well-trained professionals in many fields and providing pioneering resources for community service.,,
